Add your answers to the questions below.

1.  What is the runtime complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` method?
    O(n)

2.  What is the space complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` function?
    O(h)

3.  What is the runtime complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method?
    O(n)

4.  What is the space complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method?
    O(w)

5.  What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
    O(n logn)

6.  What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
    Space complexity is O(n \* m) i believe because we have two arrays here. If it alrered an array it would be O(n)
